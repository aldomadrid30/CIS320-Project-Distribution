This code is amazing. It would have been better if you would have made it our own (let me know if I am wrong here).
You did a good job at separating and explaining segments of the code. I can kind of understand what each function does and 
how the code works now. I would still have like to see some graphs. 

I would give this person a 2 out of 4 or a C.
